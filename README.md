# Document-Digitization
The name of our software is document digitization service. Digital system is a system in which we can store,             process or communicate any kind of  information in a digital form. Day by day, we are entering a digitalized world,             so all the management systems in every sector also need to be digitalized too. For the purpose of                 living an easier and better life , everything is being digitized. we need to make a system by which                 we can convert the offline records into the digitized version of record keeping. Then the records of                 the converted digital document will be stored in a database system of the finance department.                 Search and retrieval works can be done by the following system. Three different users will be there in the system such as public, private, administrators. This project contains SRS and SDS also.
